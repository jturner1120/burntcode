          In the summer of my junior year I was given the opportunity to intern
          for the Town of East Bridgewater.  They were in need of an individual
          who could learn a new piece of software, and then complete projects
          and train users.  The software was a web based implementation
          combining forms and geospatial data.  It used javascript/jquery, as
          well as PostgresSql with PostGIS for spatial data, to interface with
          the software.  I became the subject matter expert for the Town.

          I was able to build several systems for the town using the software.
          Some notable examples are a Burning Permit application and monitoring
          system for the townâ€™s Fire Department, a fire hydrant location and
          maintenance app for the Department if Public Works, and an electrical
          permitting application and processing system for the Building
          Department.  In addition to this I created several interactive maps
          for various town departments.  Examples include dog location and
          licensing, home assessments, and land ownership maps.

          As my internship ended, I was transitioned into full time work, and
          eventually, as I returned to school, into a role as a consultant for
          the town.  I continue to answer any questions and occasionally train
          town employees on the use of the software.  I am glad for the
          experience, for the strong relationships I was able to form, and I am
          proud of the work that I did.
