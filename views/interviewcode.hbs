            <p>Code for interviews.  I've read that some people love the idea,
              and that some people hate the idea.  I'm not really sure where I land.
              I know it exsists, so there is no ignoring it, but I don't know enough
              to recognize the value of fizzbuzz.</p><p>At one point I started going
              over a few examples. My first thought was that it is horrific to think
              that knowing any specific one of these examples will be responsible
              for anyone getting or not getting hired.  Then, fairly quickly, I realized some value.
              For instance, I think that the riddle and answer teach a way of
              thinking about a problem that can be valuable.  I also like the idea of being able
              to use these small examples to compare apples to apples so to speak.</p>
              <p id="fadedborder">Since I have always been a huge believer in the idea that learning and doing
              is better than just learning, I thought of this section of the site.  Here I will
            look at examples, and thier solutions in several languages.</p>
